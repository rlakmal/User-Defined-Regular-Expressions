In the realm of computer science, the need to efficiently search for substrings within larger strings is a common challenge. 
The development of algorithms like the Horsepool algorithm has significantly contributed to optimizing this process.
Named after its creator, Dr. Richard B. K. Horsepool, this algorithm has proven its prowess in string searching tasks, 
showcasing how innovative thinking can lead to substantial performance improvements.
The Horsepool algorithm is a string searching algorithm that specializes in finding occurrences of a given pattern within a larger text.
Its core principle revolves around the idea of skipping unnecessary comparisons to accelerate the search process. 
This is achieved by utilizing two main components: the "bad character" and "good suffix" heuristics.
The bad character heuristic focuses on exploiting the mismatch between the pattern and the text by skipping characters that are unlikely to match. 
When a mismatch occurs at a particular position in the pattern, the algorithm looks at the mismatched character in the text and determines 
the maximum distance by which the pattern can be shifted to align with the mismatched character. 
This precomputed shift value is then used to move the pattern to a new position, skipping several characters and reducing unnecessary comparisons.
