There is a saying that you can see the best of Sri Lanka’s cultural monuments in the three ancient cities, 
which are situated next to one another. These are Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Sigiriya. 
I visited the last two. Polonnaruwa was interesting, especially because it covers a huge place with many monuments, 
from the smallest to the ones that are much bigger. But Sigiriya was the highlight of the Sri Lankan culture for me.
Sigiriya (or Sinhagiri) is an ancient rock fortress located near the town of Dambulla. The name Sigiriya refers to 
a site of historical and archaeological significance that is nearly 200 metres high. If you ask anyone in Sri Lanka about Sigiriya,
they will proudly say it’s the 8th wonder of the world. It is a massive monument, settled in the middle of an enormous fortress.
If you want to get to the top, you must conquer very steep steps, which spiral upwards. The climb looks more daunting than it actually is.
The citadel was built just before 500 BC, and is surrounded by a double moat, the outer part of which is now dry. The water gardens,
largely dry now, are a restful place to pass time before or after your climb. temple
